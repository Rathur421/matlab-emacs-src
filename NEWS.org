* Changes and New Features in matlab-emacs

** News in 4.0

*** Cell mode: 

The matlab shell supports to execute cells which call functions, that 
are defined at the end of the same file (don't forget to add a end to
the function's definition).

*** Debugging.

Debugging is back. Set a breakpoint in the function you want to debug
(C-x C-a C-b), execute the function and use gud-next to advance.

*** Prog mode

Matlab mode is now a derived mode, based on /prog mode/.

*** Support for older Emacsen

Support for Emacsen older than 20 has been removed. Xemacs supports
has not touched, but has also not been tested, so it might be buggy.

*** Loading 
Faster load time by moving rarely used content into other files.

*** Error handling 

Clicking on errors or using next-error in matlab-shell should work better.

*** Completion 

TAB completion in the shell was revamped (but should act mostly the same)
